	 "text":"I'm Bachelor of IT graduated in 2016 who is specialized in implementing modern web-technologies and ITIL-processes. Since the beginning of 2015 I have been working at Lempinen&Partners OY as a consultant of ITSM System named ServiceNow. During this time, I have gained great knowledge on both technical and process specific levels. For instance, I have built both SOAP and REST based bidirectional integrations and implemented complex user interfaces by using Bootstrap and AngularJS frameworks. I have also implementation experiences of the ITIL processes such as request fulfillment, incident, problem and change management.\n\nIn addition to ServiceNow, I'm also attracted into latest trends of web-technics like Functional and Reactive programming. I'm already familiar with technologies as Redux, RxJS and Angular 4. Although I'm more into front-end programming, I'm good at using back-end languages like NodeJS, PHP and Java EE as well.\n\nI'm also great at communicating with both my colleagues and customers. I have faced that each customer case needs some kind of discretion. Therefore, it is important to get into mutual understanding with the opponent. This is valuable experience which I adapted whilst working as a customer support specialist at Elisa OYJ."
