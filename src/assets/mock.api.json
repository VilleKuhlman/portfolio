	 "text":"I'm experienced full-stack programmer and project manager who is specialized in implementing modern web-technologies and ITIL-processes including DevOps. My current position as a consultant of ITSM System named ServiceNow has gained me vast experience of both technical and process specific skills. For instance, I have built bidirectional integrations and implemented complex user interfaces. I have also led my own projects by acting as an accountable developer and architect during full lifecycle of the projects.\n\nI'm also great at communicating with both my colleagues and customers. Iâ€™ve seen that each case needs discretion and the most important thing is to understand the process needs behind the technical requirements. In addition, I have seen that when you put your own team first, great things will follow in the future."
